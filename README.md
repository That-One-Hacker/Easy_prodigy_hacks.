This code repository is some of the hacks that @rxzyx has on his prodigy hacks repository.  I (or @rxzyx) am not responsible for any bans, crashes, or in-game loss.  Now heed my instructions. You go to the hack, click COPY RAW FILE and only copy raw file, search up prodigy math, make an account, log in, and once you can move freely, type in on the URL bar “ javascript:”, then hit command v on mac or on anything else hit control v. This only works in chrome. Next answer the questions and you are done. Stay tuned for any updates, I will be adding one that does all the hacks at once.
